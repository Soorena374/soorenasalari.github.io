<p>Welcome to my website! Here, you'll find information about my research, publications, and academic journey.</p>

## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Concordia University, Montréal, **since January 2022**, with a research focus on **deep learning for medical image analysis** and **automatic quantification of medical image registration quality**. My work involves developing novel AI-driven solutions for **anatomical landmark detection**, **multi-modal medical image registration**, and **uncertainty quantification**, with applications in radiology and neurosurgery.

From **April 2024 to September 2024**, I was a **Research Scientist Intern at Elekta**, where I developed deep learning-based image registration methods for robust real-time tissue motion tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy. My research aims to improve both the **reliability** and **interpretability** of AI models in clinical settings.

## Education
- **PhD in Computer Science**, Concordia University, Canada (January 2022 – Present)  

- **MSc in Electrical Engineering**, Sharif University of Technology, Iran (Sep 2017 – Sep 2019)  

- **BSc in Electrical Engineering**, Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran (Sep 2013 – Sep 2017)  

## Work Experience
- **Research Scientist Intern at Elekta** (April 2024 – September 2024)  
  Working on deep learning-based image registration for real-time tissue motion tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy.  
  - Trained foundation models using Python, PyTorch, ITK, MONAI, Nibabel, and NumPy on NVIDIA A100 GPUs.  
  - Achieved a 12% improvement in image alignment by incorporating anatomical landmarks into transformation estimation.  
  - Submitted results to *IJCARS*.

- **Head of AI Group at Hami Holding** (June 2019 – January 2021)  
  Led the development of AI-driven algorithmic trading systems:  
  - Designed and implemented preprocessing and temporal analyses for time-series data and stock price prediction.  
  - Oversaw a team of programmers working on AI and backend data analysis.
